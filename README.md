# scraps-of-time
You are lost in uncharted lands of the world, without any help and are surrounded by dangerous creatures. 
The Earth has been destroyed and you are the only human left in the world. 
Your only hope is to make the Time Machine to travel to when the humans lived and save the Earth. 
This is not an easy task though, having the materials of the Time Machine so rare, 
and you also have to fight dangerous creatures to get to the materials.
